##USE:
This is very usefull to test your front en projects, or share working mockups.

Just uploaded your project to the *public* folder, and you will see a direct access on the index.html of your server.

##How it is working?

It is just using Express as a websever an a rest API.

-Webserver: will serve all the files inside the public folder

-API: using a service, will read all the index files in the subfolder of public and make a list.
